    "faq.home.q3": "I've worked with agencies who over-promised and under-delivered. Why should I trust you?",
    "faq.home.a3": "We believe in transparency and data. Every strategy is backed by analytics, and we provide detailed monthly reports showing exactly what's working. Our automation systems also give you real-time visibility into performance.",
